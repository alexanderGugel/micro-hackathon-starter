Micro Hackathon Starter
=======================

A boilerplate for **Node.JS** web applications fine-tuned for Micro Hackathons.

During my time at [Hack Reactor](http://www.hackreactor.com/), I realized that I usually spend about ~10 minutes during Micro Hackathons on setting up a Node.JS server using Express, setting up CoffeeScript, Bower and creating a decent package.json file. Since Hackathons are - by definition - **really** short, I realized that creating a boilerplate might be useful.

This repository is meant to be a boilerplate for micro projects (~ 2h). Nevertheless, it is also suited as a starting point for bigger projects.
